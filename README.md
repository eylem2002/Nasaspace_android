## **Introduction**
 developed an App designed to visualize NASA space fire data on a map, and this app offers several additional features. 
address challenges using drones and thermal cameras, providing an effective solution.
This solution not only helps save human lives but also represents a significant time-saving innovation in wildfire management.


## **PROJECT DETAILS**
-  Drone Part :The concept behind this section involves the creation of a drone specifically designed for deployment in fire-affected areas.
This drone is equipped with a thermal camera that captures essential data. However, the drone faces a limitationâ€”it cannot distinguish between people,
animals, or other objects. To overcome this challenge, we employ computer vision (AI) to construct a model capable of differentiating between
people and other entities, prioritizing human safety. Additionally, in situations where individuals are trapped by the fire, we promptly
transmit their location to the firefighters. To address this issue effectively, we utilize GIS (Geographic Information System)

+ Data Collection Process: The process commences with the collection of vital data. This includes gathering information regarding the
fire's location, size, and the direction of its movement. This data is drawn from diverse sources, encompassing satellite imagery, 
weather reports, and updates from the fire department. Subsequently, to ensure the safety of individuals
,it is imperative to identify the safest evacuation routes and the optimal paths for firefighters to reach the trapped individuals.

* Evacuation and Firefighter Route Planning: To guarantee the secure evacuation of individuals and
facilitate the firefighters' access to the trapped people, it is crucial to pinpoint the most secure paths away from danger zones. 
This is where GIS comes into play, employing road network data to ascertain the optimal evacuation routes for evacuees and the best paths for firefighters. 
These routes are then communicated to the firefighters, ensuring a rapid and safe response to reach those in need.
